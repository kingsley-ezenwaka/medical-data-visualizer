# Medical_Data_Visualizer Project

## Introduction

The *Medical Data Visualizer* is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that investigates a dataset of anonymous patients' medical information, and explores the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

The objective of the project is to **visualize and make calculations from the medical examination data using NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn**.

### Data description
The dataset is a record of anonymous patient's medical information collected during medical examinations. The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. The dataset will be used to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.
